## Practical-8 :  User Management App

## Description
Created a dummy project named “user-management-react-app” in react from scratch.
Added two routes using react-router-dom - /signup and /home

/home - page after login - UI should contain profile picture and the following text:
“Hello {Name}, you are registered with the email id - {Email} and phone number - {PhoneNo}”
Along with a logout button on the top right.

Used Formik & yup library for handling form validations.

Used redux to store data of user.
